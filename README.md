Executive Summary
The use of the internet for online shopping has grown dramatically over the past decade. The ease of buying goods by sitting at the comfort of their homes has provided the consumers a myriad of choices while making a purchase. When we look at the current scenario, almost three out of every five companies are using e-commerce as a means to offer their goods and services. Our website is designed in a way to cater to these existing demands of the consumer.

Project mission:
We are an online shopping website that offers a wide variety of gift products to our consumers. We acquire licensed products by forming strategic partnerships with several companies and sell them through our website. Our business model is a B2C model that deals directly with our consumers.
